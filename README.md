The animal used to maneuver on every terrain very efficiently and have the capability to survive on earth. In order to perform agile motions on concrete, sand, soil, sponge, and hard surfaces, a biological system must have the capability to recognize the terrains through their legs and sensing capabilities. For making decisions to navigate through these terrains, one must have to differentiate between these surfaces. This study proposes a novel technique to understand and differentiate the terrains using robot legs. In the present study, we propose to use the proprioceptive information of leg joints and record on different terrains. The results were analyzed to understand the behavior of robotic legs in different terrains. The developed leg is found to recognize the different terrains efficiently.
